API Overview
============

The OMERO json API described here provides create, read, update and delete
access to an underlying OMERO server. 
The majority of the API urls use [omero-marshal](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/omero-marshal)
to generate json dictionaries from OMERO **model** objects. The json dictionaries will be populated
with all fields of the OMERO model object, such that changing a single field and sending this
back to OMERO will update the object accordingly.
All these url are under the ```m``` prefix:

    <server>/api/m/


In addition, a smaller number of API urls perform customised
queries as used by the webclient. These queries use **projections** and
typically load a subset of fields for
OMERO objects in order to improve performance for large data counts.
These urls are available under the ```p``` prefix:

    <server>/api/p/


Pagination
----------

Requests that return a number of items will be paginated by default.


**Parameters**

    Name        Type        Description
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    page        Number      Page number, starting at page=1 (default)
                            Can use page=0 to disable pagination return all results
    limit       Number      The size of each page. The default can be set in
                            $ bin/omero config set omero.web.page_size 100

Error handling
--------------

Invalid parameters or invalid JSON will result in a ```400 Bad Request```:

    {"message": "Invalid parameter value"}


Unhandled exceptions are handled with a ```500``` error response that will
include the error



Image containers
================

OMERO organises images in 2 types of many-to-many hierarcies:
``screen/plate/[Run]/Well/image`` for HCS data and ``projects/datasets/images``
for other data. images can also be ``Orphaned`` if not contained within
a ``Well`` or ``dataset``.
OMERO also supports ``Shares``, which provide more permissive access 
to the list of images linked to a Share.

List all top-level containers
-----------------------------

List containers that are not children of other containers.
This includes a virtual ``Orphaned images`` container that
gives the number of orphaned images.
This is equivalent to the initial display of data in the clients.
